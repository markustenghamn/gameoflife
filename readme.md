# Conway's Game of Life using pixel in Go

[See video demonstration](https://youtu.be/AmTsYkoaiGs)

This is a simple program the implements Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) which I put together I was learning batching using the pixel library (https://github.com/faiface/pixel).

The original game of life code is not written by me, the source can be found here https://golang.org/doc/play/life.go
